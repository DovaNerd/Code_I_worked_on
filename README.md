# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio feel free to have a look at some of the previous projects I have worked on if you are interested in either the scripts I have written in C++ or C# based projects. If you would like to see how the projects look overall I have a collection of links to their Itch pages as well as links to their GAMECON 2021, 2022 showing here you can view alternative promotional material as well as get visit their itch pages after should you want to. Some projects I have worked on however, didn't have itch pages (Gaia's Grasp, ) so I have taken the liberty of reposting it and linking them in the additional trailers text file located in the project links folder as well. If you have any questions or would like any clarification feel free to reach out and ask

Thanks!!!
